# The use of Cloud Data Management systems
In this document I will discuss two articles regarding the use of Cloud Data Management systems by presenting two opposing views on its use.

## Article 1
In _AutomationWorlds's_ [Assessing Cloud Computing’s Value]
(https://www.automationworld.com/analytics/article/21259443/assessing-cloud-computings-value)

Cloud data management is the process of storing company data on an off-site server that is usually owned and overseen by a vendor specializing in cloud data hosting. Managing cloud data offers an integrated backup plan, technical support, and ease of access from any location. Other benefits include reduced costs, scalability, speed, and reliability

Cloud technologies have long reduced the barriers associated with infrastructure, hardware, maintenance, and resources. There are many benefits associated with storing data _in the cloud_. One of the most important reasons why cloud computing is getting popular for organizations and regular people alike is its possibility of remote access. The pandemic has forced organizations to re-evaluate how their employees work with each other and the importance of collaborative technologies is now more than ever. Therefore the age of cloud data management is upon us with lowered barriers to entry and relatively cheap maintenance for all types of organizations to achieve a greater level of efficiency.

## Article 2
On the contrary, this article explains the risks associated with what AutomationWorld had to say. In _THEFORECAST_ by Nutanix [Four Biggest Risks of Cloud Computing and How to Mitigate Them] 
(https://www.nutanix.com/theforecastbynutanix/technology/four-biggest-risks-of-cloud-computing-and-how-to-mitigate-them)

It is said that data is the most _valuable_ asset of an organization today and so it is important to understand the costs and risks associated with cloud data management as well. Migrating from a normal to a cloud-based system is one of its biggest issues as making even a simple mistake would risk exposing user data. This also signifies the threat of cyber-attacks for which businesses are a frequent target as breach strategies are known to be evolving at a faster rate than security defenses. 

Cloud data management service providers host data for thousands of customers and so a single security breach would be **fatal** for a number of companies across the globe. Furthermore, when using a cloud service provider, lack of control is also an important factor which means that the organization is, at some times, at the cloud data management company’s mercy for the services that are being provided. If the organization is faced with a problem that results in them not being able to pay bills, the data management company may decide to delete the data that it is keeping for a more affording client. Therefore, keeping data on cloud data management company has its risks and benefits for the consumer to weigh before going for it.
